# üç£ RollCall Development Roadmap (v5.0 ‚Äî Iterative Canonical)

**Philosophy**: Local-first, cloud-backed. iOS 15+, MVVM-C, Xcode-only builds, DI via initializers, TDD. The phone is the source of truth; server is a replica for sharing.

## Invariants (do not change)
- **Platform**: iOS 15+ only; Swift/SwiftUI; Xcode builds (no SwiftPM).
- **Architecture**: MVVM-C; strict boundaries; DI via initializers; unidirectional flow.
- **Data**: Core Data local storage.
- **Concurrency**: async/await; structured concurrency; careful cancellation.
- **Quality**: TDD; ‚â•60% coverage for MVP (‚â•80% for Sync Beta); SwiftFormat/SwiftLint; zero force-unwraps outside tests (tests allowed w/ rationale).
- **CI/CD**: xcodebuild build/test; Conventional Commits; Sentry + dSYMs; os_log with privacy levels.
- **Design System**: "Kawaii Minimalism"; tokens (rcPink/rcRice/rcSeaweed‚Ä¶); WCAG 2.2 AA (AAA for CTAs); a11y labels/hints.
- **Domain vocabulary**: Roll, Chef, Restaurant, Rating, Omakase, Nigiri/Maki/Sashimi.

## P0 Immediate Next Steps (auto-managed)

**Scope**: Only the smallest set of actions required to unblock MVP progress right now. Each item must be atomic, testable, and independently verifiable.

- **RC-P0-029** ‚Äî Fix missing waitForExpectations in MainTabViewModelTests
  - **Rationale**: Test has 4 expectations with fulfill() but no waitForExpectations causing test timeout.
  - **Deliverables**: Add waitForExpectations after all expectations set up.
  - **Acceptance**: MainTabViewModelTests runs without timeout.

- **RC-P0-030** ‚Äî Fix missing waitForExpectations in AppCoordinatorTests
  - **Rationale**: Test has expectations with fulfill() but no waitForExpectations causing test timeout.
  - **Deliverables**: Add waitForExpectations after all expectations set up.
  - **Acceptance**: AppCoordinatorTests runs without timeout.

- **RC-P0-031** ‚Äî Verify full test suite execution
  - **Rationale**: After fixing expectation waits, need to verify all tests pass and measure coverage.
  - **Deliverables**: All tests execute successfully with coverage metrics.
  - **Acceptance**: `xcodebuild test` completes within 120 seconds with coverage ‚â•60%.
  - **Dependencies**: RC-P0-029, RC-P0-030

- **RC-P0-032** ‚Äî Set up CI metrics collection
  - **Rationale**: Need automated CI metrics to drive future P0 iterations.
  - **Deliverables**: Script to generate ci-metrics.json from test results.
  - **Acceptance**: ci-metrics.json generated with accurate build/test/coverage data.
  - **Dependencies**: RC-P0-031

<!-- PHASE_BACKLOG -->
## Phase Backlog (reference, stable)

### 1 ‚Äî Design System + API Contracts (DEFERRED Aug 15‚Äì16)
Tokens (DesignSystem/Tokens.swift), components (PrimaryButton, EmptyStateView, LoadingView, RollCard), a11y audit. API DTOs frozen in `/docs/api_v1.md`.

### 2 ‚Äî Infra + Observability (Aug 17‚Äì19)
Photos pipeline (sandbox copy, thumbnail cache), perf harness with deterministic inputs, Telemetry + Sentry, AppError, feature flags/killswitch.

### 3 ‚Äî Roll Creation Polish (Aug 20‚Äì22)
Guest profile UUID, biometric lock toggle, 3-tap creation, optimistic insert, bg photo processing.

### 4 ‚Äî My Rolls (Local) (Aug 23‚Äì26)
Fast list + details + edit/delete; search/filter; persist prefs; 60fps on 200 items.

### 5 ‚Äî Profile & Polish + TestFlight (Aug 27‚Äì29)
Profile stats, settings, App Store privacy strings, icon/launch assets, CI gates.

### 6 ‚Äî Cloud Sync + Basic Auth (Sep 1‚Äì5, FF)
Backend (Fastify/Postgres/R2), signed uploads, LWW merge, updated_since + cursor pagination, iOS Sync Service, public feed (flagged).

<!-- METRICS -->
## Quality Gates & Metrics (auto-managed)

- **Build (main target)**: GREEN ‚úÖ
- **Build (test targets)**: GREEN ‚úÖ
- **Coverage**: BLOCKED (tests timeout due to missing waitForExpectations)
- **SwiftLint**: 0 violations ‚úÖ (clean!)
- **SwiftFormat**: 0 errors ‚úÖ (clean!)
- **Tests Passing**: TIMEOUT ‚ùå (19 expectation.fulfill() with 0 waitForExpectations)
- **Architecture**: MVVM-C compliance ‚úÖ
- **Perf (p90)**: Save ‚â§700ms (not measured); Feed load ‚â§200ms (not measured)

<!-- RISKS -->
## Risks & Mitigations (living)

- **Tests blocked** ‚Üí Mitigation: RC-P0-001; CI "fail fast" on compile errors.
- **Lint debt hides defects** ‚Üí Mitigation: RC-P0-003; forbid rule disables.
- **Timeline squeeze** ‚Üí Mitigation: Keep P0 small; defer polish to Phase 3/5.
<!-- /RISKS -->

## Definition of Done (per phase)

- Follows CLAUDE.md + RollCall guidelines (MVVM-C, unidirectional flow, @MainActor only in UI).
- Tests pass; coverage gate met; perf gate met; lint clean.
- Feature works offline; AA audit passed.
- Merged to main with CI green and release notes updated.

<!-- ACCEPTANCE_TESTS -->
## Lightweight Acceptance Tests (copy to CI)

1. **Create Roll E2E (offline)** ‚Üí persists across relaunch.
2. **Edit/Delete** ‚Üí list/UI consistent; Core Data state correct.
3. **Perf** ‚Üí save p90 ‚â§700ms; list p90 ‚â§200ms (seeded).
4. **A11y** ‚Üí VoiceOver completes Create‚ÜíSave; 44pt targets; AA contrast.
5. **Sync (flagged)** ‚Üí Two devices converge <10s; backend down = app usable.
