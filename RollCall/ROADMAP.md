## Quality Gates

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Build Main | ‚úÖ Green | Green | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Build Tests | ‚úÖ Green | Green | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Test Coverage | ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure | ‚â•60% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Tracking Issue |
| SwiftLint Violations | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ Pass |
| SwiftFormat Warnings | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ Pass |
| SwiftFormat Errors | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Test Failures | 0 | 0 | ‚úÖ Pass |

**Notes**:
