# RollCall P0 Management

Manage P0 items for the RollCall MVP development.

Usage: `/p0 [list|current|next|done|block]`

## Actions:

### List All P0 Items
Show all P0 items from ROADMAP.md:
1. Extract items between `<!-- P0_TASKS -->` and `<!-- /P0_TASKS -->`
2. Display with status indicators:
   - ‚úÖ Completed (in CHANGELOG)
   - üöß In Progress (current)
   - ‚è≥ Pending
   - üö´ Blocked

### Current P0
Show the P0 item currently being worked on:
1. Check MACHINE_STATE for current p0_ids array
2. Display full details from P0 Plan including:
   - Title and rationale
   - Deliverables
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Verification commands

### Next P0
Identify the next P0 item to work on:
1. Find first pending item without blockers
2. Check dependencies are met
3. Display what needs to be done

### Mark Done
If $ARGUMENTS contains a P0 ID (e.g., "RC-P0-015"):
1. Move item from P0_TASKS to CHANGELOG
2. Update MACHINE_STATE p0_ids
3. Run validation to ensure nothing broke
4. Commit with message: `feat(p0): complete $ID`

### Mark Blocked
If $ARGUMENTS contains a P0 ID and reason:
1. Add blocker annotation to P0 item
2. Update blockers in state
3. Suggest alternative P0 items to work on

## Examples:
- `/p0` - List all P0 items with status
- `/p0 current` - Show current P0 being worked on
- `/p0 next` - Show next P0 to implement
- `/p0 done RC-P0-015` - Mark RC-P0-015 as complete
- `/p0 block RC-P0-016 "Waiting for API design"` - Block item with reason
