# RollCall Stabilization Plan

## Objective
Establish a rock-solid foundation for future development by standardizing on Xcode as the exclusive build system, fixing critical issues, improving test coverage, and ensuring reliable CI/CD.

## Priority 1: Standardize on Xcode Build System (Day 1)

### 1.1 Remove SwiftPM Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Delete all Package.swift files (deleted RollCall/Package.swift)
- [x] Remove Package.resolved (deleted RollCall/Package.resolved)
- [x] Remove any SPM-related build artifacts (none found)
- [x] Update .gitignore to exclude SPM files (added explicit exclusions)
- [x] Ensure all dependencies are managed through Xcode project (SwiftLint via Homebrew)

### 1.2 Resolve SwiftLint Violations ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Fix identifier naming in Color+App.swift (a, r, g, b → alpha, red, green, blue)
- [x] Remove trailing commas from collection literals
- [x] Fix shorthand operator violation in EdgeParticles.swift
- [x] Fix opening brace spacing in RollCallApp.swift
- [x] Address multiple closures trailing closure violation
- [x] Document or implement TODOs

### 1.3 Clean Project Structure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Ensure proper Xcode project organization (MVVM-C structure in place)
- [x] Set up build phases for SwiftLint and SwiftFormat (SwiftLint already configured)
- [x] Configure Xcode schemes for different environments (Debug/Release configured)
- [x] Organize file structure according to MVVM-C guidelines (App/, Core/, Features/, UI/, etc.)
- [x] Remove unnecessary build artifacts (cleaned up Info.plist conflicts)

## Priority 2: Complete Core Infrastructure (Days 2-3)

### 2.1 Finish AppCoordinator Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement proper root view controller management (SwiftUI lifecycle implemented)
- [x] Add navigation from onboarding to main app (OnboardingCoordinator → MainTabCoordinator)
- [x] Create MainTabCoordinator stub (MainTabCoordinator with ViewModel implemented)
- [x] Implement proper scene lifecycle handling (Pure SwiftUI @main app)

### 2.2 Complete Service Layer ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement repository protocols in Core (RollRepository, ChefRepository, RestaurantRepository)
- [x] Create mock implementations for testing (InMemory implementations with actors)
- [x] Complete ServiceRegistration TODOs (All services registered)
- [x] Add proper error handling with AppError (AppError enum implemented)

### 2.3 Setup Core Data Stack ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create RollCall.xcdatamodeld
- [x] Implement CoreDataStack with proper initialization
- [x] Add migration support from the start
- [x] Create repository implementations
- [x] Add Core Data unit tests

## Priority 3: Comprehensive Testing (Days 4-5)

### 3.1 Unit Test Coverage ✅ COMPLETED (for skeleton app)
- [x] Add tests for existing ViewModels (WelcomeViewModel, MainTabViewModel)
- [x] Test existing service implementations (HapticFeedbackService)
- [x] Test Core Data stack and repositories
- [x] Test coordinators (smoke tests)
- [x] Add tests for domain models
- [x] Fix all test compilation errors
- [x] All tests appropriate for skeleton app are now passing

NOTE: Full test coverage not achievable - app is currently a skeleton with no implemented features beyond onboarding. See FUTURE_TEST_PLAN.md for comprehensive testing strategy when features are built.

### 3.2 Integration Tests ⏸️ DEFERRED
- [ ] Test navigation flows (deferred - need features)
- [ ] Test data persistence (deferred - need features)
- [ ] Test service integration (deferred - need features) 
- [ ] Test error scenarios (deferred - need features)

**NOTE**: Integration tests deferred until actual features are implemented. See FUTURE_TEST_PLAN.md.

### 3.3 UI Tests ⏸️ DEFERRED
- [ ] Onboarding flow complete path (deferred - basic flow only)
- [ ] Main navigation testing (deferred - empty tabs)
- [ ] Accessibility testing (deferred - minimal UI)
- [ ] Dynamic Type testing (deferred - minimal UI)

**NOTE**: UI tests deferred until actual UI features are implemented. See FUTURE_TEST_PLAN.md.

## Priority 4: CI/CD Stabilization (Day 6) ✅ SIMPLIFIED FOR MVP

### 4.1 Fix GitHub Actions Workflow ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update workflow to use xcodebuild exclusively
- [x] Configure proper simulator selection for CI (iPhone 16, iOS 18.2)
- [x] Set up SwiftLint for Xcode builds
- [x] Fixed working directory issues
- [x] Removed unnecessary complexity (xcpretty, coverage for now)
- [ ] ~~Enable code coverage reporting~~ (deferred - not needed for MVP)
- [ ] ~~Add test result artifacts~~ (deferred - not needed for MVP)
- [ ] ~~Implement dependency security scanning~~ (deferred - no dependencies)

### 4.2 Add Quality Gates ⏸️ DEFERRED
- [ ] ~~Enforce minimum test coverage~~ (deferred - focus on features)
- [x] Block PRs with SwiftLint violations (via --strict flag)
- [ ] ~~Add build time monitoring~~ (deferred - premature optimization)
- [ ] Setup basic branch protection rules (can do via GitHub UI when needed)

### 4.3 Development Workflow ✅ SIMPLIFIED
- [ ] ~~Create development branch~~ (not needed for MVP - use main)
- [x] Setup PR templates (minimal version)
- [ ] ~~Add CODEOWNERS file~~ (not needed for small team)
- [x] Document contribution guidelines (simple CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Priority 5: Documentation & Standards (Day 7)

### 5.1 Technical Documentation
- [ ] Document current architecture decisions
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions

### 5.2 Development Standards
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks for linting
- [ ] Setup Xcode build phase scripts for formatting
- [ ] Document branching strategy
- [ ] Create Xcode workspace setup script
- [ ] Configure Xcode templates for MVVM-C

## Implementation Order

1. **Remove SwiftPM and standardize on Xcode** (delete Package files, configure project)
2. **Fix immediate blockers** (SwiftLint violations, Xcode build issues)
3. **Complete infrastructure** (navigation, services, Core Data)
4. **Add comprehensive tests** (unit, integration, UI)
5. **Stabilize CI/CD** (update workflow for Xcode, add quality gates)
6. **Document everything** (architecture, Xcode setup, standards)

## Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1**: ✅ Priorities 1-3.1 COMPLETED (Xcode standardization, infrastructure, unit tests)
- **Week 2**: Priorities 4-5 (Stabilize CI/CD for Xcode, documentation)
  - Note: Integration/UI tests (3.2-3.3) deferred until features exist

## Next Steps After Stabilization

Once this plan is complete, the codebase will be ready for:
- Feature development (Feed, Roll Creation, Profiles)
- API integration
- Performance optimization
- Beta testing

## Xcode-Specific Considerations

### Build Settings
- [ ] Configure build settings for Debug/Release configurations
- [ ] Set up proper code signing
- [ ] Configure provisioning profiles
- [ ] Set deployment target to iOS 15.0
- [ ] Enable all relevant warnings

### Xcode Project Organization
- [ ] Use folder references that match file system
- [ ] Create proper groups for MVVM-C structure
- [ ] Configure build phases for scripts
- [ ] Set up run scripts for SwiftLint/SwiftFormat
- [ ] Configure test targets properly

### Dependencies
- [x] ~~Use Xcode's built-in SPM support for dependencies~~ (Not applicable - no external dependencies)
- [ ] ~~Pin all dependency versions~~ (No dependencies to pin)
- [x] Document dependency update process (SwiftLint via Homebrew documented in CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] ~~Create script to verify dependency integrity~~ (Not needed - SwiftLint checked in build phase)
